Package hdns is an unofficial library for the Hetzner DNS API.

The library's documentation is available at [GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/fnyu/hdns-go/hdns).

The official public API documentation is available at https://dns.hetzner.com/api-docs.

Some parts of the codebase were copy-pasted directly from the official hetznercloud/hcloud-go package. The intention was to maintain some level of compatibility between those clients so it is easier to adapt both of the libraries in the same project.

## Example

```go

## Go Version Support

The library supports at least Go 1.18 and Go 1.19. It is possible that it could be used with older versions, but I have not tested this library against them.
